I just wanna hear us sound like the song that's in my head; something to look back on when we're gone (not to say we're going somewhere).

I'm on my way...
Hell, I know I've let you down.
Don't act so surprised.
I don't get the look in your eyes.
I just want to know, did you have a swinging time?
Something to look back on when we're gone (not to say we're going somewhere)?
I swear, I've heard that one before.
Don't get in my way, I know where I'm going.
I'm on my way home.
