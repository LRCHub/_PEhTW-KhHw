Beloved woman of my mind
The rose of many men
In your strength I find
The will to rise again
My horse has long since died
My fever kicking in
And I long to ride
Through the grass again
Beloved woman of my mind
The rose of many men
In your strength I find
The will to rise again
Though my horse has died
My fever kicking in
I know that I will ride
Through the grass again
