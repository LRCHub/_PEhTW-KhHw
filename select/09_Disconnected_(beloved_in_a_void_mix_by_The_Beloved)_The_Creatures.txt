Don't you think it funny
Don't you think it sad
I was thinking of you
Thinking frozen land
Make the heart grow fonder
Don't make it separate
Just a small reminder
A keepsake

And when you're feeling sad
Can't imagine happiness
And when you're feeling glad
Alaska shows her greedy hand
Don't you think it funny
Don't you think it sad
Starting to fade in Siberian land

In Siberia

Just when you're comforted
Just when you start to breathe
The winter pounces
Like a band of thieves
Oh the pain of joy
Oh the joy of pain

Zoom in
Zoom out
Cut
Pullback
Fade to black

You're disconnected
Disconnected

Make the heart grow fonder
Then obliterate
Just a small reminder
A keepsake
Don't you think it funny
Don't you think it sad
Nothing left of you in this Arctic land

In Antarctica
